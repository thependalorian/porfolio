# Coding Standards

This skill provides the 23 essential coding standards that must be followed with every piece of code you write, ensuring scalable, efficient, and maintainable codebases.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Writing any code
- Creating components
- Implementing API endpoints
- Reviewing code
- Planning implementations
- Ensuring code quality

## The 23 Essential Rules

### 1. Always Use DaisyUI
- Utilize DaisyUI for all UI components to maintain consistent styling across the application.

### 2. Create New UI Components
- Always create new, modular UI components to facilitate easy bug fixes and maintenance.
- Avoid large, monolithic components by breaking them into smaller, manageable pieces.
- **ALWAYS ask if you should break a component down into smaller chunks first.**

### 3. Component Documentation
- Each component must include a comment at the top explaining:
  - Purpose
  - Functionality
  - Location within the project

### 4. Vercel Compatibility for Endpoints
- Ensure that any endpoint created will **always work when deployed on Vercel**.
- Test in localhost:3000 and deploy to Vercel.
- This should always be considered in **ALL code you write**.

### 5. Design Quick and Scalable Endpoints
- Design all endpoints to be quick and scalable.
- Optimize performance to handle increased load without degradation.

### 6. Asynchronous Data Handling
- When pulling data or chaining multiple endpoints, implement asynchronous operations or data streaming.
- Prevent long wait times for users.
- Use techniques to show data quickly, rendering stuff on client side if possible.

### 7. API Response Documentation
- When receiving a response from an API, add comments and descriptions within the endpoint.
- Clearly outline the response structure.
- This facilitates easier chaining of APIs together.

### 8. Database Integration with SSR
- Integrate your chosen database using Server-Side Rendering (SSR).
- Ensure secure and efficient data access.
- Choose the appropriate database based on requirements.

### 9. Maintain Existing Functionality During Debugging
- When debugging or adding new features, always preserve the existing functionality.
- Prevent breaking current features.

### 10. Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging
- For complex APIs, include detailed error checks and logging.
- This aids in debugging, especially after deployment on Vercel.

### 11. Optimize for Quick and Easy Use
- Ensure the application is fast and user-friendly.
- Rapidly pull data from databases or external APIs.
- Use best practices to minimize the need for loading animations.

### 12. Complete Code Verification
- **Every command you write must ensure that the code is complete, correct, error-free, and bug-free.**
- Verify all dependencies between files.
- Ensure all imports are accurate.

### 13. Use TypeScript
- **TypeScript is being used.**
- All development must be done using TypeScript with proper type definitions.

### 14. Ensure Application Security and Scalability
- Build a secure, hack-proof, and scalable application.
- Use modern coding techniques to reduce server workload and operational costs.

### 15. Include Error Checks and Logging
- All code must contain error checks and logging.
- Handle edge cases effectively.
- Adhere to the standards of a senior developer.

### 16. Protect Exposed Endpoints
- Implement rate limiting.
- Secure endpoints with API keys or other authentication methods.
- Prevent unauthorized access.

### 17. Secure Database Access
- Ensure all interactions with the database are performed securely.
- Follow best practices to protect user data.

### 18. Step-by-Step Planning for Every Task
For every task or message, **first**:
1. Plan the approach meticulously.
2. Read and understand the existing code.
3. Identify what needs to be done.
4. Create a detailed, step-by-step plan, considering all edge cases.
5. Only then implement and write the code.

### 19. Utilize Specified Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (v14) with App Router and SSR
- **Backend/Database:** Choose based on requirements:
  - **SQL:** PostgreSQL (Supabase, Neon, Railway), MySQL (PlanetScale, Railway)
  - **NoSQL:** MongoDB, Redis (caching), DynamoDB (AWS)
  - **Serverless-friendly:** Supabase, Neon, PlanetScale, MongoDB Atlas
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Free Plan), Railway, Render, or other serverless platforms
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
- **Payment Processing:** Stripe (to be set up at a later stage)

### 20. Consistent Use of Existing Styles
- Always use existing styles from the codebase.
- Maintain consistency in padding, animations, styles, tooltips, popups, and alerts.
- Reuse existing components whenever possible.

### 21. Specify Script/File for Code Changes
- **Every time you suggest a change to the code**, **always specify which script or file** needs to be modified or created.
- This ensures clarity and organization within the project structure.

### 22. Organize UI Components Properly
- **All UI components must reside in the `/components` folder** located in the root directory.
- **Do not create additional components folders.**
- Place all components within this designated folder.

### 23. Efficient Communication
- **Be efficient in the number of messages** used in the AI chat.
- Optimize interactions to maintain productivity and streamline the development process.

## React Hooks Best Practices

Use these React hooks to speed up coding and keep it simple and efficient:

- **`useRef`** - For accessing DOM elements and storing mutable values
- **`useState`** - For component state management
- **`useEffect`** - For side effects and lifecycle management

## Integration with Design Principles

These coding standards align with software design principles:

| Coding Rule | Design Principle Connection |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| **Rule 2: Modular Components** | **KISS** - Simple, manageable pieces |
| **Rule 18: Step-by-Step Planning** | **Avoid Over-engineering** - Plan before building |
| **Rule 9: Maintain Existing Functionality** | **Boy Scout Rule** - Leave code better than found |
| **Rule 20: Consistent Styles** | **DRY** - Reuse existing components |
| **Rule 4: Vercel Compatibility** | **Ship Stable Code** - Production-ready from start |

## Database Considerations

### Choose SQL When:
- ✅ Structured data with clear relationships
- ✅ Need ACID transactions (financial, e-commerce)
- ✅ Complex queries with JOINs
- ✅ Strong consistency required

### Choose NoSQL When:
- ✅ Unstructured or semi-structured data
- ✅ High write throughput needed
- ✅ Horizontal scaling required
- ✅ Flexible schema needed

## Component Architecture

Following Rule 2 (Modular Components) and Rule 22 (Component Organization):

```
/components
├── ui/              # Base UI components (Button, Input, Card)
├── forms/           # Form-specific components
├── layout/          # Layout components (Header, Footer, Sidebar)
├── features/        # Feature-specific components
└── shared/          # Shared utilities and helpers
```

## Code Review Checklist

- [ ] All 23 rules are followed
- [ ] Components are modular and documented
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly defined
- [ ] Vercel compatibility is ensured
