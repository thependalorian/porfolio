                  <p>
                    Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the influence of news sentiment on AMD stock prices from 1984 to 2024. 
                    Utilizing time series techniques, I examined 159 daily observations and 473 monthly observations, revealing 
                    significant predictive relationships. The findings indicated that daily news sentiment had a stronger impact 
                    on stock returns than annual report sentiment, with the 7-day moving average emerging as the most important 
                    predictor for forecasting stock prices.

                    Analyzed two Kaggle datasets comprising 458,177 Airbnb listings from 2020 and 2023 to assess the impact 
                    of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rental market. The analysis revealed average prices between $200 and $300 
                    per night and identified the most booked unit types, providing crucial insights for potential investors 
                    looking to navigate the recovering market.

                  <p>
                    Developed predictive models for optimizing loan investments in peer-to-peer lending, analyzing over 
                    1.8 million loans worth $15 billion. The project identified a 13.5% default rate and interest rates ranging 
                    from 6.7% to 22.8%. I implemented three return calculation methods, finding that the optimistic method 
                    yielded the highest returns, albeit with increased risk. This project demonstrated the effectiveness of 
                    data-driven strategies in investment decisions and confirmed that recent data models consistently outperformed 
                    random selections.

                  <p>
                    Kit Star is a custom shipping containerized aquaponics and organic vertical farm solution. This project 
                    creates a symbiotic relationship between fish and plants, reducing waste and producing fresh, healthy produce. 
                    The vertical farm setup optimizes the use of space within the container, maximizing harvest potential and 
                    providing a sustainable food production system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The inspiration for Kit Star came from the challenges faced by The Land's Sake Farm and similar organizations 
                    in sustainable agriculture. We aimed to address limited space and resources while revolutionizing their operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges was creating a sustainable closed-loop system between the fish and plants. 
                    We learned the importance of optimizing space while ensuring a healthy environment for both.

                    FRONT-AI addresses the complex challenges in healthcare data management, particularly in complying with HIPAA regulations. 
                    This project simplifies the management of sensitive patient data for healthcare organizations, ensuring compliance while 
                    being user-friendly.

                  <p>
                    We built a specialized hardware device capable of operating offline for maximum security, integrating a custom-trained 
                    Large Language Model (FRONT-LLM) to process healthcare data in accordance with HIPAA guidelines.
